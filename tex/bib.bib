  abstract = {The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a well-known personality test that assigns a personality type to a user by using four traits dichotomies. For many years, people have used MBTI as an instrument to develop self-awareness and to guide their personal decisions. Previous researches have good successes in predicting Extraversion-Introversion (E/I), Sensing-Intuition (S/N) and Thinking-Feeling (T/F) dichotomies from textual data but struggled to do so with Judging-Perceiving (J/P) dichotomy. J/P dichotomy in MBTI is a non-separable part of MBTI that have significant inference on human behavior, perception and decision towards their surroundings. It is an assessment on how someone interacts with the world when making decision. This research was set out to evaluate the performance of the individual features and classifiers for J/P dichotomy in personality computing. At the end, data leakage was found in dataset originating from the Personality Forum Café, which was used in recent researches. The results obtained from the previous research on this dataset were suggested to be overly optimistic. Using the same settings, this research managed to outperform previous researches. Five machine learning algorithms were compared, and LightGBM model was recommended for the task of predicting J/P dichotomy in MBTI personality computing.},

Social work has a long history of social reform and helping efforts. Let us continue this by paying attention to the important message of this book. --Eileen Gambrill, PhD, School of Social Welfare University of California at Berkeley (From the Foreword) Although many psychosocial interventions used in social work practice have strong research evidence supporting their efficacy, a surprising number do not, potentially resulting in harmful outcomes. In this book, the authors cast a critical eye on the reality of commonly used scientific and pseudoscientific practices in social work today. Stressing the need for separating research-based practices from those not supported by adequate levels of evidence, they examine the scientific and pseudoscientific bases for popular social work interventions used in a variety of treatment settings. The text examines the misuse of legitimate research and describes how social work education training can and should discourage pseudoscience. The concluding chapter describes pathways through which social work practice can become more firmly grounded in contemporary scientific research. This engaging book is intended for courses in critical thinking and evidence-based practice and is a valuable resource for all social work students and practitioners. Key Features:  Promotes critical thinking regarding the evidence-based research--or lack thereof--behind a variety of social work interventions Written by renowned social work educators Addresses the history and characteristics of pseudoscience Examines pseudoscience practices in assessment and work with children, adolescents, adults, and individuals with developmental difficulties},

  abstract = {The acceptance phenomenon (i.e., the general tendency for persons to accept almost any bogus personality feedback; Layne, 1979) may be related to certain paranormal beliefs (Alcock, 1981; Hyman, 1981). Paranormal beliefs are beliefs in phenomena that, if authentic, violate basic limiting principles of science (Broad, 1953; Tobacyk \& Milford, 1983). One specific illustration of the acceptance phenomenon is the "Barnum effect," which refers to acceptance of bogus personality feedback consisting of relatively trivial statements with a high base rate (Layne, 1979; Snyder, Shenkel, \& Lowery, 1977). The Barnum effect has been implicated in personal validation and in "cold reading," both of which are used routinely by many astrologers, clairvoyants, faith healers, fortune tellers, graphologists, mediums, Tarot Card readers, and others (Hyman, 1981). It was hypothesized that paranormal beliefs emphasizing divinatory procedures that produce personalized feedback (i.e., precognition, spiritualism, superstition, and witchcraft) are associated with greater susceptibility to the Barnum effect.},

However, less attention has been paid to the textual information derived from the user behaviors. In this paper, we investigate the effect of textual information on user behaviors for personality prediction. Our experiments on the personality prediction of Twitter users show that the textual information of user behaviors is more useful than the co-occurrence information of the user behaviors. They also show that taking user behaviors into account is crucial for predicting the personality of users who do not post frequently.},

However, since the existing recommendation method (e.g. collaborative filtering) has two fundamental problems: (i.e., data sparsity and scalability problem), it has difficulties with reflecting users’ personality. In this paper, we propose the MBTI-CF method to solve these problems and to involve users’ personality by building personality-based neighborhood using MBTI. In order to verify the efficiency of the proposed method, we conducted statistical testing by user survey (anonymous users have rated set of the pre-selected Webtoon contents). Three experimental results have shown that MBTI-CF provides improvement in terms of the data sparsity problem and the scalability problem and offers more stable performance.},
